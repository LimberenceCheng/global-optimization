# Simulated Annealing

Simulated annealing (SA) is a probabilistic technique for approximating the global optimum of a given function. Specifically, it is a metaheuristic to approximate global optimization in a large search space. It is often used when the search space is discrete (e.g., all tours that visit a given set of cities). For problems where finding an approximate global optimum is more important than finding a precise local optimum in a fixed amount of time, simulated annealing may be preferable to alternatives such as gradient descent.

This work implementing simulated annealing to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) between US state capitals. Briefly, the TSP is an optimization problem that seeks to find the shortest path passing through every city exactly once. In our example the TSP path is defined to start and end in the same city (so the path is a closed loop).
